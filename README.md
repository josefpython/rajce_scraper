# rajce_scraper
Python webscraper used to download either an entire album or only certain images from rajce.idnes.cz <br>
Requires selenium with a driver (chrome default), requests and bs4 <br>
The entire thing was built in like 3 hours so it might break lol<br>
m.in is the input file for the numbers of images you wish to download, <br>
the paths to the album itself and the selenium driver must be changed directly in rajce_scraper.py <br>
